															Project Overview
														</p>
														<p>
															Over the past year, your employer has experienced a decline in the number of returning customers and a corresponding decline in revenue. To investigate, the company leveraged customer feedback and surveys and determined that the decline in retention rates is likely due to a combination of factors, including; a lack of variety in our product offerings, poor customer service, and increased competition from other retailers. As a Data analyst, your employer invites you to explore the 
															factors contributing to the decline in retention rates and identify potential solutions to improve retention and increase revenue.

														<p>
															Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, and it plays a critical role in the well-being and development of individuals and communities. Nigeria, like many other developing countries, faces significant challenges in providing adequate healthcare services to its population. One key factor that affects healthcare access and utilization is the availability of health facilities.
														</p>
														<p>
															In this analysis, we will examine the number and distribution of health facilities in Nigeria and evaluate their capacity to cater to the health burden of the population. Specifically, we will look at the types of health facilities available, their geographic distribution, and their capacity to provide quality healthcare services.
														</p>
														<p>
															The analysis aims to answer the following questions:
														</p>
														<p>
															1. How many health facilities are available in Nigeria, and what types of facilities are they?
															2. Are the health facilities distributed evenly across the country, or are there areas with inadequate access to healthcare services?
															3. What is the capacity of the health facilities to provide quality healthcare services, and are they equipped to handle the health burden of the population?
														</p>
														<p>
															Answering these questions can provide valuable insights into the healthcare system in Nigeria and inform policymakers on areas that need improvement to ensure that all Nigerians have access to quality healthcare services.

													<p>
														Project Overview
													</p>
													<p>The report is an analysis and visualization of causes of death around the world, classified into disease-related and non-disease-related categories. 
													It aims to provide insights into the major causes of death, trends over time, and differences between countries and regions in both disease-related and non-disease-related mortality patterns. 
													The report uses data from various sources, including the World Health Organization and national statistical agencies, to create a comprehensive picture of mortality patterns worldwide.
													The report is important because understanding the causes of death is critical for public health policy and planning. By identifying the leading causes of death, policymakers can target interventions to prevent or mitigate those causes.
													</p>
													<p>Additionally, understanding the variation in mortality patterns across countries and regions can help policymakers identify areas for improvement and allocate resources more effectively.
													The classification of causes of death into disease-related and non-disease-related categories provides further insights into the underlying factors contributing to mortality patterns. 
													By examining both disease-related and non-disease-related causes of death, the report sheds light on the impact of both health behaviors and social determinants of health on mortality patterns worldwide.
													Overall, the report provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of global mortality patterns and can inform public health policy and practice at local, national, and global levels.
